Title: About

I initially created this site using [Hyde](http://www.github.com/hyde/hyde) to refresh my web development skills. I've since moved everything over to [Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/), so I don't have to use my hacked together IPython notebook support. I'm pretty happy with how easy everything is now.
