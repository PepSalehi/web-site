I'm a Ph.D candidate in economics and econometrics in DC. My research focuses on topics in information theory and entropy econometrics and applications thereof. I am also a Python nerd. This site is a place to park some code snippets and advertise some software projects. I'll also attempt to blog about my research, linux, and projects. Past history suggests that I will not be all that prolific.
