Python Packages
---------------

Windows Users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Christoph Gohlke provides a great service to the community by providing Python binaries for Windows. You can find his page `here <http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/>`_. You will want the following files (if you are on 32-bit windows, then grab the win32 files instead of amd64):

* numpy-MKL-1.6.2.win-amd64-py2.7.exe
* scipy-0.11.0.win-amd64-py2.7.exe
* ipython-0.13.1.win-amd64-py2.7.exe
* matplotlib-1.2.0.win-amd64-py2.7.exe
* pandas-0.10.0.win-amd64-py2.7.exe
* scikit-learn-0.12.1.win-amd64-py2.7.exe
* nose-1.2.1.win-amd64-py2.7.exe

**Note:** If when trying to start Python or IPython from the Command Prompt, you receive an error along the lines of::

    'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.

or::

    Bad command or filename

You need to add the directory that contains the executables to your PATH environmental variable. A quick search should turn up instructions on how to do this.

Mac Users

You can download all of the packages you will need by following the instructions provided with the `SciPy Superpack created and maintained by Chris Fonnesbeck <http://fonnesbeck.github.com/ScipySuperpack/>`_.

Linux Users
~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are on a recent distribution, you can likely install everything using your package manager. If you are on a Debian-based system, you will be able to get the most up to date packages by using the `NeuroDebian respository <http://neuro.debian.net/>`_ created and maintained by Michael Hanke and Yaroslav Halchenko.
