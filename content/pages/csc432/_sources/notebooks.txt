IPython Notebooks

Refer to the `IPython documentation <http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/interactive/htmlnotebook.html>`_ to fill in the details on the below.

Getting the IPython Notebooks for the course
--------------------------------------------
The code that we go through in class will be available on GitHub as IPython Notebooks. See the `README on github <http://github.com/jseabold/csc432-notebooks>`_ for instructions on obtaining and keeping up to date with the notebooks.

What is the IPython Notebook?
-----------------------------

You can think of it as an IPython interpreter running on a web server on your machine. It has some nice features that make it ideal to use, teach, and learn.

Starting the notebooks
----------------------

To run the notebooks, you type

    ipython notebook

at the command prompt. This should work on linux, OS X, or Windows. If this doesn't launch the notebook server in your default web browser point to 127.0.0.1:8888 (it may take a few seconds to pop up), then make sure you have installed all of the notebook dependencies as mentioned `in the documentation <http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/install/install.html#installnotebook>`_.

Setting up your profile
-----------------------

The documentation tells you how to set up your profile, and I cover what you need to know `here <https://github.com/jseabold/csc432-notebooks#creating-a-notebook-profile>`_.

What to do with the notebooks
-----------------------------

You've cloned the repository. You're able to launch the notebook server. What next? The README in the notebook repository on github mentions a bit about what you'll probably want to do and why. Make your own directory and copy the notebooks to it. Set the variable in the profile configuration file `c.NotebookManager.notebook_dir` to point to this directory. The variable configuration file is the one mentioned on the github README.

Now, the next time you start the IPython Notebook server, the notebooks in this directory should show up in the notebook dash.
