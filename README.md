This site is created using a recent (7/2/13) development version of [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest). The theme is a [slightly modified version](https://github.com/jseabold/pelican-fresh) of [pelican-fresh](https://github.com/jsliang/pelican-fresh/). I am using the liquid-tags plugin to render IPython notebooks by [jakevdp](https://github.com/jakevdp/). It was necessary to make some modifications to `_nb_header_mod.html`.
